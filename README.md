# Texteditor
## Description 
This code creates a text editor with a GUI built using Tkinter and adds features like open, save, cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, and font customization. Users can create, open, edit, and save text files using this text editor. It also provides a font selection dialog to customize the text appearance.
## Modules Used 
1. `tkinter`: This is the standard Python library for creating GUI applications. It provides the widgets and functions needed to create the graphical user interface of the text editor.
2. `filedialog`: This module is part of the `tkinter` library and is used for opening and saving files through a file dialog.
3. `messagebox`: Another module from the `tkinter` library, it's used for displaying message boxes for alerts and confirmations.
4. `scrolledtext`: This is a special widget provided by `tkinter` that creates a text widget with built-in scrollbars, making it easier to handle large amounts of text.
5. `font`: This module is used for font selection through a font dialog.
These modules are part of the Python standard library and do not require separate installation. They are commonly used in GUI applications created using `tkinter` to handle various aspects of the user interface, file I/O, and font management.
